# latex-cpp-exercises-simple

This repository contains exercises for a university programming course in procedural C++. 

The exercises are divided in 5 different blocks of increasing difficulty and use the [VSCode template](https://github.com/olimexsmart/template-vscode-cpp). As of now, exercises descriptions are written in Italian, with plans to translate them in English.

Anyone is encouraged to open a issue to ask questions or to make a pull request from a fork to contribute.
